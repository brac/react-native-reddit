# Native React Reddit
A Native React Exercise using the Reddit API

## Getting Started
This application is a prototype and may have bugs or lacking functionality. You will need a computer to run the development server. Both your development server and your device must be on the same wifi.
Be sure to install the expo app on your iOS device from the App Store.  

### For Development
After cloning the repo, run this in your command line
```bash
npm install
expo start
```
* You should now have an expo server running on your computer, and a web browser should have opened. 
* Click `Publish or republish project...`, above the QR code in the lower left corner of the window.
* Open your expo app on your iOS device. 
* click on the `Projects` icon in the lower left of the expo app on your iOS device.
* Select the application running in `Recently in Development` section. It should be the only one with an expo icon
* Enjoy a simple reddit r/pics browsing application.

### Prerequisites
Node.js
Expo client on your iphone

### Concessions
I was unable to export this project to iOS, as I do not have access to a suitable development mac at this time. This application does run nicely through the expo client.
